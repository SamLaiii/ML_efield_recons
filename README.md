# ML_efield_recons
This work will investigate the use of ML to perform denoising of traces and/or E-field reconstruction
1. Run Python data.file --directory (directory of Jitter dc2 simulation) --NJ_directory (directory of Non-Jitter dc2 simulation) --save_folder (directory of npz data file want to save) in the GRAND_Denoiser.
2. Run python main.py --save_folder (directory of training results want to save) GRAND_Denoiser.
